<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Skin Biopsy Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Shave Biopsy</li><li>Excisional Biopsy</li><li>Incisional Biopsy</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The skin biopsy market comprises three main types: shave biopsy, excisional biopsy, and incisional biopsy. Shave biopsy involves removing the superficial layers of the skin, often used for superficial lesions. Excisional biopsy entails the complete removal of a lesion along with some surrounding tissue, ideal for deeper lesions. Incisional biopsy, on the other hand, involves removing a portion of the lesion for analysis, useful for larger growths that cannot be fully excised. Each type serves specific diagnostic purposes in dermatology.</p></p>
