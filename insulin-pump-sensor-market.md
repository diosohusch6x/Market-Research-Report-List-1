<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Insulin Pump Sensor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Invasive Glucose Sensor</li><li>Non-Invasive Glucose Sensor</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The insulin pump sensor market is divided into two main types: invasive and non-invasive glucose sensors. Invasive glucose sensors require a small device to be inserted under the skin to monitor glucose levels continuously, providing accurate and real-time data. In contrast, non-invasive glucose sensors measure glucose levels without penetrating the skin, using methods like infrared spectroscopy or electromagnetic waves. Both types aim to enhance diabetes management by enabling better insulin delivery and improving overall patient outcomes.</p></p>
