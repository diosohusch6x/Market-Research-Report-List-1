<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Radial OTR Tires Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Inner Tube</li><li>Tubeless</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The radial OTR (Off-the-Road) tires market features two main types: inner tube and tubeless tires. Inner tube tires consist of a separate inflatable tube inside the tire, providing additional cushioning and ease of repair. In contrast, tubeless tires are designed to hold air without an inner tube, reducing weight and minimizing the risk of punctures. Tubeless designs enhance safety and performance, making them increasingly popular in heavy-duty applications, while inner tube tires remain valued for their traditional reliability.</p></p>
